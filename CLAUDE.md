# Change My Letters

Documentation, including specifications, tech stack, architecture and coding standards is found in the `docs` sub-directory, 
with `docs/contents.md` being a table of contents that has pointers to all the pages in that directory.

Important note on TODOs - read [docs/todo-based-workflow.md]. A TODO id is not a file name. It is a unique label for content
in a documentation file or source code file (so find it using a string search).
