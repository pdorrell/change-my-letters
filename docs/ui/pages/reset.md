# Reset Page

The Reset page is entered when the "Reset" button is pressed from one of the two 
pages that support a reset function, which are:

* Word Changer
* Make

Reset page allows the user to choose a new initial word from the page that invoked it.

The page contains:

* A heading indicating which page is being reset
* Instructions on how to reset (TODO - merge the heading and the instruction)
* Controls panel, consisting of:
   * Filter controls, as described in [../common/filter.md].
   * A "Choose Random" button
* A panel display the possibly filtered list of all the words in the word list.

The user can either:

* Click on "Choose Random" to reset the invoking page to a randomly chosen word.
* Click on a word in the list of words to reset to that word.

There is currently no "Cancel" button, but the user can effectively cancel by
by clicking on the invoking page (or any other page) in the main navigation menu.
