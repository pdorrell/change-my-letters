# Pronunciation Activity Page

The Activity sub-page is where users can explore the relationship between the pronunciations
of words that start with, end with or contain a specified substring (i.e. the filter text).

The page consists of:

## Controls

* Filter controls as described in [../common/filter.md].
* "Auto" button, which causes the filtered words to be pronounced automatically in sequence.

## Mini-header panel

* Word count showing how many words are selected by the filter
* An explanation of keyboard shortcuts
* "â†»..." button to reset the maximum number of words shown back to 20

## Word List

The word list shows the list of filtered words. By default at most the first 20 words are shown,
with an ellipsis button shown if there are more words to show. Clicking on the ellipsis button
doubles the maximum number of words to show. The maximum is reset back to 20 if any change is made
to the filtering controls.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

* Left & right arrows to go to previous or next word
* Alt-right to start autoplay
* Escape to stop autoplay

In auto mode, any mouse or keyboard interaction stops the auto.
